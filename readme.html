<H1>StP Database Administrator for MS Access 
version&nbsp;2.0 Readme</H1>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>StP Database Administrator (DBAdmin below)&nbsp;is a 
tool that allows you to manage your MS Access databases through your browser, 
providing various set of functions you can perform with your databases, without 
having downloading them, changing and uploading again. Most of features needed 
for database management are included, you can even create a new blank databases 
on-line.</P>

<ul>
  <LI>ASP enabled web server (such as IIS or PWS) - 
  <strong><em>required</em></strong>           
    
  <li>Sessions enabled on your web server - 
  <strong><em>required</em></strong>      
  <LI>Any Mozilla-compatible web browser: MS Internet 
  Explorer 5.x or higher, Netscape 6.x or higher, Opera, Mozilla - 
  <strong><em>required</em></strong>      
          
  <LI>Write permissions on the web server - 
  <strong><em>optional</em></strong>
  <li>MSXML parser installed on server - 
<strong><em>optional</em></strong></li></ul>

<p>For the full versions history,&nbsp;see <A href="history.htm" >History.htm</A> file.</p>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Below are steps that you should perform to successfully 
install DBAdmin.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Double click on the downloaded archive file and 
  choose a directory where all unzipped files should be placed. This directory 
  is temporary and can be safely removed after installation. 
  <li>Open file "scripts\inc_config.asp" in any text editor 
  such as Notepad and find the line:<br><font color=green 
  >Const DBA_cfgAdminPassword = "<strong 
  >admin</strong>"</font><br>This is 
  your password as administrator. You should change it to your own, so just 
  replace "admin" with your new password. 
  <li>Optional - DBAdmin uses Session object to store some 
  settings and transfer them from page to page. If you want to change those 
  Session variables names, you can do this in same "scripts\inc_config.asp" file 
  - see remarks inside it. 
  <li>Optional - If you want to use XML file to store your configuration and 
  database paths, you should update the value of <font 
  color="green">DBA_cfgProfilePath</font>         
    in the same file,&nbsp;and set it to a virtual path to XML 
  file. Note that the folder where this&nbsp;file will reside MUST be 
  created and has write access. 
  <li>Now save configuration file, create some directory on 
  your Web server (for example&nbsp;"dbadmin") and upload all files, including 
  subfolders into it. 
  <li> Configuration is done. Open your browser and 
  navigate to DBAdmin main page ("default.asp").</li></ol>
<H3>Upgrade from previous version</H3>
<P> You should remove any previous version installed on 
your server and upload the new one as is (after changes described in Installation 
section).</P>

  ><b>Cannot create a blank 
  database</b></font><br>Make sure you that the folder in 
  which you are trying to create a new database has write permissions. Usually 
  there is always at least one folder that has it - a folder where your hosting 
  provider lets you to place your MS Access databases <br>

  ><b>I got an error "TypeLib not 
  found" in inc_protect.asp</b></font><br>A type library for ADO is 
  not registered on your server, so you cannot use METADATA tag to specify it. 
  Usually it happens on Windows 98 machines, but fortunately can be solved 
  easy.&nbsp;Open the file "scripts\inc_config.asp"&nbsp; in any text editor 
  (such as Notepad) and find the line below: <br><font color="green">&lt;!-- 
  METADATA TYPE="typelib" uuid="00000205-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4" 
  --&gt;</font> <br>This should be the last line in this file. Delete it and 
  instead type this text:<br><font color="green">&lt;!--#include file=adovbs.inc 
  --&gt;</font><br>      
                
              
          
       This      
                
              
          
       fix should solve
  the problem of ADOType  library

  >I can't see Views created with Database Administrator in 
  MS Access.</STRONG></FONT><BR>
				MS Access doesn't support Views, only Stored Procedures (named Queries in MS 
				Access) can be created and changed. Stp Database Administrator, which uses ADO, 
				&nbsp;has full support for both Stored Procedures and Views. But if you want to 
				be able to see your Views in MS Access later, always create them as Stored 
				Procedures.
