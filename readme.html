		<H1>StP Database Administrator for MS Access version 1.7 Readme</H1>
		<H3>Overview</H3>
		<P>StP Database Administrator is a tool that allows you to manage your MS Access 
			databases through your browser, providing various set of functions you can 
			perform with your databases, without having downloading it, changing, uploading 
			again. Most of features needed for database management are included, you can 
			even create a new blank databases on-line.</P>
		<H3>Requirements</H3>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			ASP enabled web server (such as IIS or PWS) - on server side
			<LI>
			Any Mozilla-compartible web browser: MS Internet Explorer 5.x or higher, 
			Netscape 6.x, Opera, Mozilla
			<LI>
				Write permissions on the web server - optional</LI></UL>
		<H3>Installation</H3>
		<P>The installation is easy. Just unzip all files in the downloaded archive and 
			place them on&nbsp;your server&nbsp;to some directory on your choice (should be 
			accessible from web). After you have uploaded all files, navigate to this 
			directory to the page "default.asp" and login with password "admin". Now you 
			should change the default password to your own.<BR>
			In case you don't have write permissions on your web server, you should edit 
			the "config.asp" file manually and change the "admin" password to your own.</P>
		<H3>Upgrade from previous version</H3>
		<P>When upgrading from previous version you should always replace all files but one 
			- "config.asp". This file has not been changed and to avoid losing your 
			settings (such as your password), do not override it. All other files should be 
			replaced to avoid problems and apply any chages and bug fixes.</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>
				<A name="a1_a2"></A><font color="red"><b>Why I get "Permission denied" when trying to 
						change my password?</b><br>
					<b>When I'm opening a database I get this error: "Couldn't save configuration file: 
						Permission denied"</b></font><br>
				When you are changing a password or opening a database, Database Administrator 
				tries to save settings in "config.asp" configuration file. Some hosting 
				providers doesn't have write permissions to all directories on the web, so 
				saving a file failes. In case of password you should manually edit "config.asp" 
				file, change the password and upload it again to your web site. With databases 
				you should use "Browse" button to specify the path to your database.
				<BR>
			<LI>
				<A name="a3"></A><font color="red"><b>Cannot create a blank database</b></font><br>
				Make sure you that the folder in which you are trying to create a new database 
				has write permissions. Usually there is always at least one folder that has it 
				- a folder where your hosting provider lets you to place your MS Access 
				databases
				<br>
			<LI>
				<A name="a4"></A><font color="red"><b>I got an error "TypeLib not found" in 
						inc_protect.asp</b></font><br>
				A type library for ADO is not registered on your server, so you cannot use 
				METADATA tag to specify it. Usually it happens on Windows 98 machines, but 
				fortunately can be solved easy. In the zip archive there is one file called 
				"inc_protect_adovbs.asp". You should rename it to "inc_protect.asp", 
				overwriting existing one. Make sure that the file "adovbs.inc" (included in the 
				archive) is in same folder as the rest of files
				<br>
			<LI>
				<A name="a5"></A><font color="red"><b>I don't have write permissions, so how to save 
						connections manually?</b></font><br>
				Open "config.asp" file in any text editor (such as Notepad) and edit the last 
				line (variable "strDatabases"), writing the full path to your database. 
				Remember that the path should be on your web server and not on your home 
				computer. Separate each database with vertical line - "|". Example:<BR>
				<FONT color="green">Const strDatabases = 
					"c:\Inetpub\databases\myfirstdb.mdb|C:\Inetpub\Databases\mysecond.mdb"</FONT>.
				<BR>
			<LI>
				<FONT color="red"><STRONG>I can't see Views created with Database Administrator in MS 
						Access.</STRONG></FONT><BR>
				MS Access doesn't support Views, only Stored Procedures (named Queries in MS 
				Access) can be created and changed. Stp Database Administrator, which uses ADO, 
				&nbsp;has full support for both Stored Procedures and Views. But if you want to 
				be able to see your Views in MS Access later, always create them as Stored 
				Procedures.
				<BR>
			<LI>
				<STRONG><FONT color="red">What is that trash that I see instead of ASP script in the 
						source files?<BR>
					</FONT></STRONG>The whole Database Administrator is encoded using Microsoft 
				Script Encoder, thus I will be sure that the source won't be changed or used in 
				any way other than administration of your databases. There are several files 
				left unencoded, such as language files or configuration.
